#summary List of third party plugins and front-end applications for mupen64plus

This page has been created to list all of the third-party plugins and front-end applications for mupen64plus, in order to facilitate research. It's aim is to be a central place to find the different available plugins.

If you have made a plugin for mupen64plus which is not in this section, please contact dorian.fevrier with a link of the web site, so that it may be added to this list.

= Official Plugins =

!Mupen64Plus has 5 of its own official plugins: mupen64plus-input-sdl, mupen64plus-audio-sdl, mupen64plus-rsp-hle, mupen64plus-video-rice, and mupen64plus-video-glide64mk2. If you have a problem with one of them, you should report it via [http://code.google.com/p/mupen64plus/issues/list the issues list]. 

= Third-Party Front-end and Launcher Applications =

Front-ends are applications which use the !Mupen64Plus core emulator and compatible plugins, and present a user-interface.  The only front-end included with the core !Mupen64Plus bundle is a command-line only program.  Third-party front-ends are developed and maintained outside of the main !Mupen64Plus project but are compatible with !Mupen64Plus 2.0.  They are supported *by their authors*. If you have a problem with one of them, the best thing to do is to contact directly the author, who is the best placed person to answer you.

== Front-End Applications under active development ==
|| *Application Name* || *Description* ||
|| [http://m64py.sourceforge.net/ m64py] || Python-based GUI Front-end using !PyQt ||
|| [http://openemu.org/ OpenEmu] || OSX application which includes many different emulators. ([https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu Development Site]) ||

== Front-end Applications not under active development ==
|| *Application Name* || *Description* ||
|| [http://www.mudlord.info/emulators/ winmupen] || Windows-specific GUI Front-end ||
|| [http://bitbucket.org/auria/wxmupen64plus/wiki/Home wxMupen64Plus] || A frontend with full support for configuration (mostly tested on OSX at this point) ||
|| [http://www.emutalk.net/showthread.php?t=50438 Gtk64] || GUI Front-end based on the object oriented GTKmm library ||
|| [http://sourceforge.net/userapps/mediawiki/vknecht/index.php?title=CuteMupen CuteMupen] || GUI front-end using Qt ||

== Launchers ==
The difference between a full Front-End application and a Launcher application is that a Front-End application links directly with the !Mupen64Plus libraries and can integrate very closely with the emulator to provide features like GUI emulator controls, an integrated video window, and graphical debugger.  A Launcher application does not link directly with the !Mupen64Plus libraries, but uses the "mupen64plus-ui-console" command-line application to run the emulator.  This type of application is easier to develop, but cannot provide the more advanced features.

= Third-Party Plugins =
